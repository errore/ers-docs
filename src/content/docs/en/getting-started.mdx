<Aside type="tip" title="Welcome!">
👋 This is the help page for ERS, which can help you get started quickly and choose a rendering pipeline according to your project needs.
</Aside>

## 1. What is ERS

ERS (Easy Rendering Solution) can add lighting support to your Unlit materials, or use **forward rendering** mode to completely customize the appearance of your materials.

Since native rendering pipelines are used, ERS materials are compatible with most features in the engine, such as lightmaps, reflection captures, and post-processing effects.

## 2. How to Configure ERS

<Steps>

1. Launch your UE project, open the `Plugins` window, and ensure that the ERS plugin is enabled.

2. Restart UE to make the changes take effect.

2. ERS has been configured in your project, and you can now start using ERS to add lighting support to your Unlit materials 🥳!

</Steps>



## 3. Choose the UE Rendering Pipeline You Want to Use

ERS supports two rendering pipelines: `Forward Rendering` and `Deferred Rendering`. You can choose the appropriate rendering pipeline based on your project requirements.

<Aside type="tip" title="How to Choose a Rendering Pipeline?">
1. **Forward rendering pipeline** is suitable for most situations, while **deferred rendering pipeline** is suitable for scenes that require complex lighting effects.
2. In ERS, if you want to `completely customize` the appearance of your materials, it is recommended to choose the **forward rendering pipeline**.
3. For beginners, you can start with the configuration-simple **deferred rendering pipeline**.
</Aside>

### 3.1 Deferred Rendering Pipeline

The deferred rendering pipeline is UE's default rendering pipeline. No additional configuration is required to use ERS's deferred rendering functionality.

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">

If you are using **UE 5.7**, you need to search for `Substrate` in Project Settings and disable the `Enable Substrate (Beta)` option, otherwise ERS will not work properly.

### 3.2 Forward Rendering Pipeline

To use the forward rendering pipeline, you need to configure the following in your project settings:

Search for `Forward` in Project Settings and enable the `Use Forward Shading` option.
